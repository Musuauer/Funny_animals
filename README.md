# Funny Animals Memory Game Project

Project #2 for the Front-End Developer Nano Degree from Udacity, under a Google Scholarship.

We were given a skeleton HTML and CSS, plus a single Javascript function to shuffle the cards. After that, the task was to build the whole game, including a time counter, moves counter, star rating and a modal to show the results once you win the game.

Having my three year old son in mind, I designed the game oriented to toddlers, using funny images of animals and adding some color to the cards.

## Instructions

1. Click on a card to flip it and reveal its image.
2. Click on another card to see if they match.

   If they match, they will stay open.

   If they don't match, they will be flipped again.

3. Find the 8 pairs of funny animals, look at your time and how many stars you will earn.
4. Try to do it faster next time, as the cards will have a new random order.

**Have fun!**
